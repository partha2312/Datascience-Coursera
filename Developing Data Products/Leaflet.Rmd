This aim of this exercise is to use leaflet and display a map in the browser. 

Down below you will see the location of Statue of Liberty (one of my favorite location in the US).

If you click on the little ballon which is the location, you will get a pop up. Click on the link provided and you can know more about that location.

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles()
StatueOfLiberty <- c("<a href= 'https://www.nps.gov/stli/index.htm'>Statue of Liberty</a>")
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=40.6892, lng=-74.0445, popup = StatueOfLiberty)
```
