Please read through this file before running the code present in Code directory.

The program reads through a text file and creates various vizualizations.

The Main.R contains the main function which sources other R files to perform manipulations on data and create plots.

The PlotHelper.R contains functions to plot various types of graphs and also to download the graphs as png files.

The Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R contains the call to PlotHelper with some data to be plotted.

For some reason the filesize of the data on my Mac is 130 MB and the git is not allowing me to push the data file on to the repository.
